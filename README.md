# CV Study Journey

A 16-week structured journey to master computer vision from fundamentals to deployment, designed to build a portfolio for big-tech roles.

## Overview

- Tools: Python, PyTorch, OpenCV, TensorFlow, Streamlit, Gradio
- Topics: Classification → Detection → Segmentation → Tracking → Deployment
- Datasets: Real-world datasets (CIFAR-10, COCO, etc.)
- Goal: Build a GitHub-ready CV portfolio with clean code, demos, and documentation

## Progress Tracker

| Week | Theme               | Focus                              |
|------|---------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 1    | CV Foundations       | Image basics, OpenCV, filters       |
| 2–3  | Classification       | CNNs, PyTorch, CIFAR-10             |
| 4–5  | Transfer Learning    | ResNet, fine-tuning, Grad-CAM       |
| 6–7  | Object Detection     | YOLOv5, bounding boxes, mAP         |
| 8–9  | Segmentation         | U-Net, pixel-level masks, IoU       |
| 10   | Tracking             | Object re-identification, SORT      |
| 11–12| Document Tasks (NLP) | OCR, layout parsing, embeddings     |
| 13–14| Deployment           | Streamlit, Gradio, ONNX, quantization |
| 15–16| Capstone             | Full project + demo + write-up      |
